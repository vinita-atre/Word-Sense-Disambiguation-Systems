If the Fed eventually chooses to use brokers for its currency transactions, the lines also could deliver sizable chunks of profitable business.

formation	My eyes were wide open in search of the unknown. As I moved my platoon of 20-odd teen-agers through the jungle, I chose to walk third in the line of march.
product	Noxell uses a second major agency, Chicago-based Leo Burnett, for its Clarion line; Burnett is already a Procter agency and could be considered for future assignments. Meanwhile, industry executives already have begun speculating that Lintas might take on another cosmetics line, such as Maybelline, a unit of Schering-Plough.
text	Journalist Linda Ellerbee recalls in her book, "And So It Goes," reading news on television about the collision of two jumbo jets on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. She writes that she ended the report "with a poignant line about 576 people whose vacations had ended in death."
product	Amdahl Corp., backed by Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., has a growing share of the market with its low-priced, IBM-compatible machines. And National Advanced Systems, a joint venture of Japan's Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems, is expected to unveil a line of powerful IBM-compatible mainframes later this year.
phone	But a new breed of investor is going high tech. Some carry beepers that alert them to sudden market changes; others rent or buy portable computers that retrieve financial-news wires by telephone line.
formation	But the agreement gave Znaniye the right to omit the final chapter, which deals with religious upbringing of children in the family, according to the Russian translator, Renata Ravich. Judging by the lines at the book fair, Soviet publishers could make a fortune if they only had the nerve to push religious glasnost a little further.
product	Revlon sold Bain de Soleil to Procter & Gamble Co. The few major beauty lines still owned by pharmaceutical companies include Schering-Plough Corp.'s Maybelline and Pfizer Inc.'s Coty line.
text	It has rebounded a bit to 13.5%, however, since the company returned to the "Aren't you glad you use Dial?" line a few years ago. Sara Lee Corp. walked away from the line "Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee" and experimented with other jingles that never quite caught on with consumers.
division	"On the whole, I would as soon not have done it." Some draw the line at far more mundane requests.
product	Then the company took a hard look at its remaining businesses. "We asked what was it possible to do to eliminate expense without hurting the long-term vitality of those lines," Mr. Mockler says.
product	Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., and EMC Corp. agreed to drop suits against each other as part of a settlement under which EMC will be granted a license to use some Digital technology. Digital, a computer company, sued EMC in U.S. District Court in Boston in 1985 charging that one line of EMC's computer memory products infringed on Digital patents.
text	"Planter's is giving us cashews for 'Broadway Bound,'" says Mr. Marasek. "The cast goes through a pound a show, even though there's only a line about one nut in the script.
product	She said the tires are shaved to low tread depth for competition. Japan's Yokohama couldn't be reached, but industry experts said its A001R/A008R line also is a racing-style tire.

product	United's shares closed at $34.50, down 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Quarterly sales grew in flight systems, which includes Sikorsky helicopters, and defense electronics and aircraft products lines; building systems, primarily Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioning systems; and industrial products, such as automotive products, Essex wire and cable, and control systems.
division	But because so few suits are filed over competitive tactics -- and almost none ever decided in court -- the hazy line between what's fair and what's illegal can be hard to pin down. "The line is not easy to define," says Mr. Hanson.
product	The team's machine would extend Cray's parallel processor architecture, which involves using more than one processor to simultaneously perform calculations on different parts of a large problem. Presumably the machine would debut in the early 1990s, after the Cray-3 model from the company's other design line.

product	<p> @ Data General Corp. introduced a line of high-performance superminicomputers that vault it past archrival Digital Equipment Corp. in the midrange-computer performance race.
formation	Those numbers should improve in 1987 because banks have pledged to lend more than $9 billion to Mexico, Argentina and Nigeria this year. But there is a long line of debtor countries looking for more loans.
division	Some people even blame IRS inaction for encouraging the epidemic of build-nothing bonds. The more aggressive securities firms "put a foot over the chalk line and looked around, and nobody said anything," says Austin Koenen, vice chairman of the Public Securities Association, "so everyone else moved over the line."
product	In any case, the benefits of the IBM and Compaq computers carry a hefty price The machines cost several hundred dollars to $1,000 more than the Tandy 1000 TX. "The performance of all the machines is pretty much the same, and the average consumer doesn't need the architecture of the new IBM line," says Michele Preston, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
product	<p> @ IBM unveiled a line of mainframe computers in a bid to win back marketing ground lost to rival Amdahl.
division	Indeed, if Mr. Wright were a member of the executive branch, even the trivia the Ethics Committee is willing to investigate might prove politically fatal. We can't get too concerned about drawing lines between public and private expenditure of an aide's time, but in 1983 former Assistant HUD Secretary E.S. Savas was driven out of Washington because one of his assistants without his knowledge had a government secretary spend 20 hours typing corrections in the manuscript for his scholarly book, "Privatizing the Public Sector."
product	In addition, IBM introduced two mainframes that fill in holes in the Sierra product line -- the 280E, which has two processors, and the 500E, which contains five. IBM also extended the range of its 4381 line of mid-range computers by announcing two high-end machines that run the new operating system software.

phone	Last September , AT&T was told to file tariffs with the commission covering " the complete interstate foreign exchange service . " It will be some time before these rates are filed , says an FCC official , because the ruling affects literally thousands of foreign exchange lines .
phone	What's your trouble ? " On the other end of the line , in the forward torpedo room of the Squalus , Lt. ( j. g. ) John Nichols struggled to maintain his composure .
product	The slower sales growth for personal computers also triggered a shakeout among personal-computer dealers that thinned their ranks by more than a third. And, as if that weren't enough, last year personal-computer prices were driven down by the many clones of IBM's standard-setting PC line of computers.
product	Last year, Chrysler put about 60% of that budget into TV, and about 40% in magazines and newspapers. Major auto makers, both domestic and foreign, have usually supported their automobile lines with massive advertising budgets placed largely in television. The shift by Chrysler represents the largest proportion of an ad budget dedicated to print by a car line of a major U.S. auto manufacturer in at least two decades, according to Jim Guthrie, executive vice president of marketing development for the Magazine Publishers of America, an industry group.
division	Government and private analysts alike don't think the Iranians are likely to mount a frontal attack, because that would invite large-scale retaliation. "They'll have to draw a line between not wanting to spread the war and doing something," says Ruhollah Ramazani, an Iranian-born scholar at the University of Virginia.
product	Most were eventually sold. In July, Mr. Kelly took Beatrice's non-food and specialty lines public as E-II. American Brands' lines of cigarette, liquor and other consumer brands fit Mr. Kelly's expansion strategy.
product	One of these, the Premier, is especially important. It is the first model in the new Eagle brand of cars that Chrysler plans to sell through the 1,400 dealers it added to its distribution network when it picked up American Motors. (The Eagle line isn't to be confused with the Eagle model formerly sold by AMC.)
product	Group executives are expected to identify competitors that Simon & Schuster can acquire to broaden its market share. Since April, for example, the company bought two more document search firms, a line of training materials for computer software and a British professional publisher.
product	In recent quarters Federal has focused on new chicken products that are geared to current consumer trends and also command higher prices. Items like its Time Trimmer line of filleted, quick-to-prepare chicken parts have been paying off.
product	The Bridgestone deal "might have been more attractive," Mr. Millis said, if Firestone had a proposed acquisition in sight for its cash from the joint venture rather than the prospect of a significant reduction in operations. Nonetheless, Mr. Millis applauded the move over an outright sale of the tire assets because the present arrangement ensures that Firestone's retail stores will continue to be supplied with Firestone-brand tires and that Firestone's network of about 3,500 independent dealers also could have a broader line of tires.
division	Ranchers play classical music to their cattle in the barns, while out in the fields, workers and their families live on diets of leftover silage. "The line between moral and immoral has vanished," says Fernando Collor de Mello, the governor.

product	In over-the-counter trading, shares of clone-maker Wyse Technology Inc. also rose, and Apple Computer Inc. stock was up sharply. "After all the dust settles from the big announcement, the long wait begins," said Apple Chairman John Sculley, contending that Apple is way ahead of IBM. Similarly, Compaq President Rod Canion said he doesn't see any need for price cuts or product changes and that IBM's new line "doesn't offer any major new advantages and isn't very aggressive from a pricing standpoint."
division	The vital judicial issue is apt , therefore , to be their accommodation . Decisions thus become essentially a matter of drawing lines .
formation	Mr. Levenson has boosted his to about 2.5%, producing TV commercials based on the 1960s Lovin' Spoonful song, "Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind." He is remodeling stores to speed up the serving lines by splitting off the slow-moving dessert and beverage sections from the entree and vegetable line.
product	<p> @ Compaq Computer's chairman, Benjamin Rosen, recalls an analyst's blunt report the day after International Business Machines introduced a spiffy new line of computers in April.

text	Fatimata Sanga, the elderly woman cast as Yaaba (which means grandmother), is stringy, bald and toothless, yet she carries herself with an ethereal gracefulness. At a news conference, Mr. Ouedraogo said the script -- which is credited to him -- had to conform to Ms. Sanga's inability to remember lines, or much of anything else.
product	Chrysler Corp. also is offering financing incentives and rebates that don't have an expiration date. A Ford analyst said another reason for offering the incentives on Taurus and Sable is to keep sales balanced across car lines.

division	<p> @ Allegis Corp.'s plan to make a $2.84 billion tender offer for 63% of its shares appeared to straddle the line in a tug-of-war between shareholders and the company's management.
product	Mattel Inc., based in Hawthorne, Calif., is expected to report more bullish numbers than it did a year ago. Helped by booming sales in its Barbie doll line, Hot Wheels racing cars and Disney toys for preschoolers, Mattel's per-share earnings should jump by better than 50% to about 70 cents, estimates Mr. McGowan.
product	While it isn't out yet, Microsoft says it will run on computers currently available, like those made by Compaq and others, as well as on the new IBM models that deviate in some ways from the standard design that Compaq uses.

product	Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. are introducing luxury models in the U.S. this fall for $35,000 to $40,000 each.

product	The company's venerable model 64 computer is in the final years of its life cycle and its personal computer line is up against new products from computer giants, including International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Tandy Corp. Meanwhile, Commodore is banking much of the company's growth on its technologically impressive Amiga computer line, which also is faced with numerous competitive obstacles in the U.S.
product	In addition, the fiscal stimulus from the Reagan presidency's record budget deficits has forced the Fed to maintain a firmer policy than it might otherwise have done. Meanwhile, increased foreign competition, domestic deregulation, and the wave of mergers and consolidation sweeping corporate America have pushed companies to lay off workers, shed unprofitable lines, adopt closer relationships with suppliers and tighten controls over inventories.
formation	I love this sign. I love it because it so blithely challenges one of the basic tenets I was raised by -- that it is rude to jump ahead of someone in line.
